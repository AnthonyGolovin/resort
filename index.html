    <p>Welcome to The Edgewater Hotel, The "Best Hotel in Seattle" (as reported by CNBC). With amazing views of the Olympic Mountains, the sparkling waters of Elliott Bay and breathtaking sunset views from your room while still staying at one of the best downtown Seattle hotels. Located near the cruise ship terminals, our Seattle hotel is in the heart of downtown. You'll be within walking distance to the city's favorite sites, but you just might decide to relax right in your waterfront room, turn on the fireplace and relax in your tub.</p>
